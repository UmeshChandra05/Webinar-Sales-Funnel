# 🔧 Dashboard Fixes - Date Filtering & UI Cleanup

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Date Range Selection Not Updating Dashboard**

#### Problem:
When changing the time period dropdown, the dashboard was not fetching new data with the selected filter.

#### Root Cause:
The `loadData()` function was using a stale closure of `dateRange` due to missing dependencies in React hooks.

#### Solution:
```javascript
// BEFORE (Broken):
const loadData = async () => {
  const result = await fetchSheetData(dateRange); // Uses stale dateRange
};

useEffect(() => {
  loadData(); // Missing dateRange dependency
}, [dateRange]);

// AFTER (Fixed):
const loadData = async (selectedDateRange) => {
  const result = await fetchSheetData(selectedDateRange || dateRange); // Explicit parameter
};

useEffect(() => {
  loadData(dateRange); // Pass dateRange explicitly
}, [dateRange]);
```

#### Result:
✅ Dashboard now refreshes immediately when you select a different time period
✅ Data is correctly filtered based on selected range
✅ Auto-refresh continues to work with the selected filter

---

### 2. **Remove Emojis from Buttons**

#### Changed:
- ❌ `📥 Export` → ✅ `Export`
- ❌ `🔄 Refresh` → ✅ `Refresh`

#### Reason:
Cleaner, more professional look without emoji decorations.

## 🐛 Debugging Features Added

To help track data filtering, console logs have been added:

### In Dashboard Component:
```javascript
handleDateRangeChange: 'Date range changed to: 7d'
```

### In Google Sheets Service:
```javascript
'Fetching data with date range: 7d'
'Parsed data count: 150'
'Filtering data for 7d, cutoff date: Sat Sep 30 2025'
'Filtered 150 rows down to 45 rows'
'Processed data - Total leads: 45'
```

### How to Use:
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Select different time periods
4. Watch the logs to see filtering in action

## 🔍 Date Filtering Behavior

### Supported Date Columns (in order of priority):
1. `timestamp` or `Timestamp`
2. `date` or `Date`
3. `createdAt` or `created_at`

### Filter Logic:
- **Last 24 Hours**: Rows from the last 24 hours
- **Last 7 Days**: Rows from the last 7 days
- **Last 30 Days**: Rows from the last 30 days
- **Last 90 Days**: Rows from the last 90 days
- **All Time**: No filtering (all rows included)

### Important Notes:
⚠️ **If a row has no valid date column**, it will be included in ALL filtered results

This is intentional to prevent data loss. To properly filter data:
1. Ensure your Google Sheet has a date column
2. Use one of the supported column names
3. Use a parseable date format (ISO 8601 recommended)

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Date Range Selection
1. Load dashboard (defaults to "Last 7 Days")
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Click the dropdown button
4. Select "Last 24 Hours"
5. **Expected**: 
   - Console logs show: `Date range changed to: 24h`
   - Loading spinner appears
   - Dashboard updates with filtered data
   - Lead count should change if data exists outside 24h

### Test 2: Time Period Comparison
1. Select "All Time" - note the total leads count
2. Select "Last 7 Days" - leads should be same or less
3. Select "Last 24 Hours" - leads should be same or less
4. **Expected**: Lead count decreases or stays same as you narrow the time range

### Test 3: Auto-Refresh
1. Select "Last 7 Days"
2. Wait for countdown to reach 0
3. **Expected**:
   - Data refreshes automatically
   - Still filtered to last 7 days
   - Countdown resets to 30s

### Test 4: Manual Refresh
1. Select any time period
2. Click "Refresh" button
3. **Expected**:
   - Data refreshes immediately
   - Maintains selected time period
   - Countdown resets to 30s

## 📊 Example Console Output

```
Date range changed to: 7d
Fetching data with date range: 7d
Parsed data count: 200
Filtering data for 7d, cutoff date: Mon Sep 30 2025 14:30:00 GMT+0000
Filtered 200 rows down to 87 rows
Processed data - Total leads: 87
```

This tells you:
- 200 total rows in Google Sheet
- After filtering to last 7 days: 87 rows remain
- Dashboard shows 87 leads
